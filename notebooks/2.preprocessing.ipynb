    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed for processing a dataset of papers, extracting, and saving the words and noun phrases from the titles and abstracts of each paper. The notebook reads the raw data of papers from a CSV file, processes each paper's title and abstract, and then writes the processed data into separate CSV files for words and noun phrases respectively. This process is performed on-the-fly, in which papers are read and processed line-by-line.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "- **Setting Up the Environment**: The script begins by importing necessary libraries and modules. It also adjusts the system’s maximum integer size to avoid errors when reading large lines from the CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Counting the Number of Papers**: It calculates the total number of papers to be processed by counting the lines in the raw data CSV file. This is done in order to have a progress bar (tqdm) that estimates the time necessary to process the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preparing Output Files**: The notebook then prepares two separate CSV files to store the processed words and noun phrases. It writes the headers to these files in preparation for data writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Processing Each Paper**: The script reads the raw data CSV file line by line, skipping the header. For each paper’s title and abstract, it performs the following steps:\n",
    "    - Extracts and processes the text to obtain words and noun phrases.\n",
    "    - Writes the processed data into the respective CSV files, associating each set of processed data with the paper’s ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: The processing is based on the script imported from `../scripts/preprocessing`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "The notebook generates two CSV files as output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A CSV file containing the words extracted from the titles and abstracts of each paper, associated with the paper’s ID.\n",
    "- A CSV file containing the noun phrases extracted from the titles and abstracts of each paper, associated with the paper’s ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row in these files corresponds to a paper from the raw data file, and contains the paper’s ID followed by the processed data extracted from the title and abstract. The processed data is stored in a comma-separated format, making it easy to read and analyze in subsequent steps of the data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important\n",
    "Be careful with the spacy tokenizer and mispelling errors from the raw text."
