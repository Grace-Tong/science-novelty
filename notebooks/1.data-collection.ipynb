    "# Overview\n",
    "The data structure of this repository is organized within a primary directory named `data`. This directory contains three subdirectories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `/raw`: Contains the raw text data of papers. This can be sourced from OpenAlex, a custom dataset, or other sources.\n",
    "- `/processed`: Contains processed versions of the papers. Papers are sorted by publication date (according to MAG). Three specific files are expected here:\n",
    "    - `papers_words.csv`\n",
    "    - `papers_phrases.csv`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Each of the processed files should have the following three columns:\n",
    "    - *`PaperID`*\n",
    "    - *`Title_Words`* (or `Title_Phrases` for noun phrases)\n",
    "    - *`Abstract_Words`* (or `Abstract_Phrases` for noun phrases)\n",
    "    \n",
    "> **_NOTE 1:_**  All papers MUST be sorted by publication date.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "While the underlying code remains consistent, users might have different data requirements. Some may prefer a custom dataset. This notebook outlines four distinct approaches to data acquisition.\n",

    "- **Approach 2**: Use OpenAlex data\n",
    "- **Approach 3**: Use a subset of Zenodo (OpenAlex papers) data\n",
