    "# New bigram \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook is designed for analyzing a dataset of papers to identify the new bigrams.\n",
    "For each new bigram, the ID is the first paper is identified and the number of subsequent papers the re-use the bigram are counted.\n",
    "\n",
    "A baseline of bigrams is defined. Bigrams that appear in the baseline are not considered as new bigrams. \n",
    "\n",
    "The script reads processed data from a CSV file, compares each bigram against the baseline, and counts the occurrences of the new bigrams. The results are then written to a new CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "- **Setting Up the Environment**: The script starts by importing necessary libraries and adjusting the system’s maximum integer size to avoid errors when reading large lines from the CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Counting the Number of Papers:** It calculates the total number of papers to be processed by counting the lines in the processed data CSV file. This is needed to keep track of the process with a progress bar (tqdm).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Creating the Baseline:** A baseline set of bigrams is created from papers published before a specified baseline year. The notebook reads each paper and adds bigrams to the baseline set if the paper’s publication year is before the baseline year.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Counting New Bigrams:** The notebook then reads the processed data of each paper and counts the occurrence of bigrams that are not in the baseline set. Each new bigram’s count and the ID of the paper in which it first appeared are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exporting the Results:** The counted new bigrams, along with the ID of the paper in which each bigram first appeared and the total count of each bigram’s occurrence, are written to a new CSV file. Bigrams that only appeared once are filtered out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "The notebook generates a CSV file containing each new bigram that is not part of the baseline, the ID of the paper in which the bigram first appeared, and the total count of the bigram’s occurrence in all papers. Each row in the file represents a unique new bigram."
